            <p> 
1. Wash the strawberries and remove the stem.<br><br>
2. Put them in a bowl together with the sugar.<br><br>
3. Cover with kitchen plastic and insert them in the refrigerator until they release their juice, for 1 hour or so. Remove them.<br><br>
4. Cover them again with the plastic and leave them in the fridge 24 hours.<br><br>

5. Pour the strawberries with their juice in a casserole dish. Add the juice of a lemon. When they break to boil, reduce the heat and let them reduce for 45 minutes.<br><br>

6. Pass the blender gently, without whipping it completely so that the jam is not too liquid. Give it one last boil and remove the foam.<br><br>

7. Sterilize the jars in boiling water for 5 minutes.<br><br>

8. Pour the jam still hot in the jars. Close them and place them face down, so that the heat causes them to close to the void. You can keep the jars of jam for a year. Etiqu√©talos and keep them in a dry place, cool and away from the light. Once opened, keep them in the refrigerator.
