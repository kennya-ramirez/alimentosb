1. To begin with the preparation of our sweet crepes, place the egg, the melted butter, the milk and the sugar in a bowl. Beat everything until the ingredients are well integrated. If you have a blender you can use it. Also add vanilla essence and keep beating.<br><br>
                   
                   
2. Now, add the flour little by little and continue to beat. We recommend that you previously sieve the wheat flour so that it is finer and the result is a softer dough. The original crepe recipe is made from this type of flour, but if you want to make a healthier we encourage you to visit our recipe for oatmeal crepes.<br><br>
                   
3. Then, heat a pan with a little butter so that the sweet crepes do not stick. When it is hot, drop the necessary amount of mixture so that you can move the pan in a circular way, distribute it without leaving empty gaps and a thin layer.<br><br>
                   
4. When the sweet crepes are filled with small bubbles you should turn them carefully. It is a dessert that is made very fast, so it should not be in the fire for more than 2 minutes. With these quantities you will get approximately 10 sweet crepes, depending on the size of the pan you use you will get more or less.<br><br>
                   
5. To combine these sweet homemade crepes you have several possibilities, you can opt for condensed milk, homemade ice cream, melted chocolate ..., in the variety is the taste! Check the following recipes and surprise all your guests with a completely homemade dessert:<br><br>

* Light condensed milk<br>
* White chocolate ice cream<br>
* Chocolate frosting<br>
