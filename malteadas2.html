1. Let your ice cream melt a little so it's smooth. The ideal temperature for shake ice cream is -7 째 C (20 째 F) and your freezer will probably keep it at -18 째 C (0 째 F). Let the ice cream rest on the table for a couple of minutes; You'll know it's ready when it's soft and easy to handle, it should be a little soft not completely melted. 
If you add the ice cream to the blender when it is still cold and hard, you will end up adding a lot of milk to make it more liquid. The proportion of milk and ice cream is very important when preparing a large shake, and too much milk will make the shake too liquid. 
For the same reason, ice should never be added to a shake. The ice will melt and dilute the flavor and creaminess of the milkshake. If you prefer a not so thick milkshake, just add a little more milk.<br><br>
                   
 2. Add three scoops of ice cream to your blender or machine to make milkshakes. The machine to prepare milkshakes is the best for preparing milkshakes since it mixes and aerates the shake at the same time. But if you do not want to invest in a professional team, a regular blender or a blender works great.
If you do not have any of these machines, you can use a large bowl and a hand mixer to mix the ice cream and milk.
When you start preparing the recipe, take the glass you plan to use for the shake and put it in the freezer. By the time your shake is ready to be served, the glass will be frozen.<br><br>
                   
                   
3. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml or 2 ounces) of milk, a teaspoon of vanilla extract and any other additional ingredients. This is when you can transform the vanilla milkshake into a malt, a chocolate, a strawberry or even a candy milkshake with pretzels and chocolate chips.<br><br>
                

4. Mix the shake for one minute. If you are using a blender, do not just turn it on and leave it unattended. Blend the mixture for a couple of seconds and then mix it by hand with a spoon. This will give you the same effect as if you were using a machine to prepare milkshakes.
Regardless of which method you are using to mix the shake (with a blender, a hand mixer, a shaker or a blender), just make sure the shake remains thick. If you insert a spoon in the shake and try to remove it, you should find some resistance.
If you like that the shake still has pieces of ice cream, liquefy it only for about 30 or 45 seconds.
If you feel it is very thick, add a little milk.
If you feel that the shake is very liquid, add another ball or half a scoop of ice cream and liquefy again.<br><br>
                
                   
5. Pour the malted into the frozen glass. If the shake has the desired consistency and is thick enough, you will need to use a spoon to transfer it from the blender to the glass. If it slides easily, it was very liquid and it would be good to add a little more ice cream.
Add a little whipped cream and a cherry. Or decorate by adding the ingredient of your choice (like fresh strawberries if your milkshake is strawberry).Serve with a spoon and a straw.
