            <p> 
                
1. Preheat the oven to 350 Â° F and have the mold you will use for the bain-marie on hand.<br><br>

2. Place the sugar for the caramel in a skillet over medium heat with the 2 tablespoons of water until it melts evenly.<br><br>
                
3. Cook until the candy acquires a golden color.<br><br>
                
4. Pour it into the mold you will use. Spread the candy carefully through the mold until it covers the walls of the mold. Let it cool.<br><br>

5. Add the eggs and liquefy only for a few seconds. Then add the evaporated milk and mix. Incorporate condensed milk and mix. Add vanilla, sugar and continue mixing until you get a homogeneous mixture.<br><br>
                
6. Strain and pour the mixture into the mold you have previously caramelized.<br><br>
                
7. Take the oven to a bain-marie for 45 minutes.<br><br>
                
8. Verify that you are ready using a skewer stick or a fine knife. If they come clean, it means that you are ready.<br><br>

9. Take it out of the oven with great care not to burn yourself and put it on a wire rack. Allow to cool to room temperature until it is completely cold.<br><br>

10. Unmold and take to the refrigerator until the moment of serving.
