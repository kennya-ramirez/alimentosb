                1. The container where we are going to prepare the ice cream, we put it in the freezer to cool down.<br><br>
2. We sift the icing sugar in a bowl or bowl.<br><br>
3. Wash the strawberries, remove the stem and chop into pieces, then make with them a puree with the help of a blender or a masher.
                4. Strain through a sieve or fine Chinese to remove all the nuggets of the strawberries.<br><br>
5. Mix the juice of the strawberries with the glass sugar wrapping it well and add the orange and lemon juices. We keep in the fridge or fridge to cool, our creamy homemade strawberry ice cream.<br><br>
6. Beat the cream until it is assembled (better if it does not mount at all), and mix it with the juices and sugar mixture that we had cooling. It should be well linked.<br><br>
7. Now pour into the mold or container that we had put to freeze, and cover it with a metal foil, we store it in the freezer.<br><br>
8. After an hour and a half or two we take out and stir well looking for uniform.<br><br>
9. This step is optional but we will make it more creamy if we take it out a few hours after we see the ice cream made and stir it up a lot, then put it in the freezer again.<br><br>
10. Let's do step # 8 or we do not have our creamy homemade strawberry ice cream (homemade recipe) ready.<br><br>
