1. Mix the yolks with milk, sugar and vanilla, and heat gently directly over the fire. The cream is then assembled and mixed.<br><br>
2. We remove without stopping with rods or wooden spoon until it thickens (if we have a thermometer, this happens from 72-75º, but we must not exceed 85º). We will scratch the bottom continuously, because it is where the mixture tends to curdle more quickly, as in any custard. Beware of lumps, if one appears we can then put a hand blender.<br><br>
 3. Cover the saucepan with kitchen plastic, touching the surface so that it does not form skin, and allow it to cool completely. We put the mixture in the fridge overnight, many professionals advise it to settle the flavors and to hydrate the proteins (for example, Paco Torreblanca does it).<br><br>
4. When the mixture is very cold, assemble the cream until it is semi-hard (be careful with passing and turning it into butter). Mix the semimontada cream with enveloping movements. We cool again half an hour.<br><br>
5. We start the refrigerator and pour the previous mixture. It should be ready in 10-15 minutes if the refrigerator is powerful enough.<br><br>
                6. Overcook the refrigerator with a spatula and transfer the soft ice cream to an airtight container to put it in the freezer to finish hardening.<br><br>
