            <p> 
                
                
1. Crumble the yeast, form a hole in the center with 1/4 of sugar, 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, 1 cup of flour and put the yeast in the center.<br><br>
                   
2. Add 3/4 cup of warm milk to dissolve the yeast.<br><br>
                   
3. Incorporate the flour little by little and add 3 tablespoons of butter until you have a homogeneous mixture.<br><br>
                   
4. Transfer the dough to a metal container and cover with a damp cloth, let stand for 30 minutes.<br><br>
                   
5. Mix the rest of the flour, cocoa powder, eggs, butter, milk and sugar.<br><br>
                   
6. When the volume of the dough that was left at rest increases, mix with the other. Leave in a metal container and stand for an hour or until doubled in size, cover with a damp cloth.<br><br>
                   
7. Knead and use a rolling pin. Spread the dough until it is 2 or 3 cm thick. Cut in the shape of a donut, a large circle and a smaller one in the center.<br><br>
                   
8. Place the donuts in a tray and let stand for 30 min or until they double their volume.<br><br>
                   
9. Fry the donuts in very hot oil and move to a dish with kitchen paper to drain the excess fat.<br><br>
                   
10. Let cool for 5 min and melt the chocolate in a bain-marie.<br><br>
                   
11. Dip each donut from the front into the melted chocolate, decorate with the white chocolate and milk sparks.<br><br>
                   
12. Serve<br><br>
