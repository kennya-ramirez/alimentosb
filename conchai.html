            <p> 
1. In a large bowl, mix the yeast and warm water. Let stand for 10 minutes. <br> <br>

2. Add milk, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup butter, egg, orange zest and salt. Gradually add the flour, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of anise.<br><br>

3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead between 3 and 5 minutes.<br><br>
            
4. Form a ball. Transfer the dough to a large oiled container and stretch evenly. Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour and 20 minutes<br><br>
                
5. In a bowl, beat the soft butter in the blender for 30 seconds. Add 2/3 cups of sugar and continue whisking until well blended. Add the cup of flour, the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and vanilla. Divide this preparation for decoration in half, and transfer it to two glass containers.<br><br>

6. Add a couple of drops of food coloring, separately for each container, until you have achieved the color you want.<br><br>
                
7. Hit the dough. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes.<br><br>

8. Divide the dough into 12 uniform balls. Place the balls about 3 inches away on baking trays lined with waxed paper. Press lightly on each ball. Divide the preparation for decoration into 12 balls and crush each one. Place a crushed ball on top of each dough ball.<br><br>

9. With a sharp knife, make small cuts on the top to imitate the grooves of the scallop shells. Cover and let rise in a warm place for another 45 minutes.<br><br>
               
10. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the trays. Let them cool on a rack.
