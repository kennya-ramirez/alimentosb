1. To start preparing the marmalade we must wash the blackberries.<br><br>

2. Then we wash a lemon and cut it in half. We squeeze half a lemon and keep the other part in the fridge.<br><br>

3. Now in a saucepan add the 600 g of washed blackberries, the juice / lemon juice squeezed and 300 g of white or brown sugar. We put the mixture to cook over low heat for about 30 minutes until the jam acquires consistency. While the mixture is cooked, we should stir it from time to time to avoid sticking to the bottom.<br><br>

4. Once 30 minutes have passed, when the mixture has thickened, we can pass the blender or pass it through a mill to eliminate any lumps or lumps that have been left. I prefer not to crush the jam because I like to find pieces of blackberry, it's a matter of taste.<br><br>

5. Finally we boil a glass jar in a large pot and pour the blackberry jam inside when it is still hot. We must fill the maximum possible (without exceeding the limit of the thread). Now we close it well and put it face down. The next morning, we can turn it around.<br><br>

6. And we're finished! Now you can store this delicious homemade blackberry jam in a cool, dry and dark place. The blackberry jam can be stored for about six in the pantry without problems. Once opened, it is advisable to store the jam jar in the refrigerator so that it stays well.<br><br>
