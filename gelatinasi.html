        <p>
  * 4 cups of low-fat milk (low-fat)<br><br>
* 1-2 medium cinnamon slices<br><br>
* 4 packages of 7 gr. each of natural grenetine without flavor<br><br>
* 1 cup of cold water<br><br>
* 1 cup of fat-free sweetened condensed milk (fat-free)<br><br>
* Berries (or red berries), optional<br>

            <p> 
                
1. Heat the milk with cinnamon over medium heat. Do not lose sight of it because it heats up fast.<br><br>
                
2. While the milk is heating, dissolve the grenetina in the cold water cup.<br><br>

3. When the milk releases the boil, the temperature drops, add the grenetina and dissolve well.<br><br>

4. Turn off the heat, add the condensed milk and stir until completely integrated. Let cool for 10 minutes or until warm.<br><br>

5. Strain this mixture in a jar to remove the pieces of cinnamon, then empty the milk into a jelly mold, or into individual glasses.<br><br>

6. Put in the refrigerator until it is firm. This will take several hours. I recommend that you prepare it the night before so that it is refrigerated all night, or early in the morning of the day you want to serve it.<br><br>

7. To unmold, with a knife or ice pick carefully separates the gelatin from the wall of the mold. Heat water and empty in a deep container. Dip the mold with the gelatin for a few seconds. Place the plate on top and with a quick and precise movement, turn over. Carefully lift the mold.<br><br>
 
8. Serve with berries if you wish.
