1. Cut the handle in thirds. Remove the pulp with a fork or peel it beforehand.<br><br>
                
2. Cook the mango with the sugar in a saucepan for 25 to 40 minutes or until it thickens. The color should be darker than the original yellow, but not darker than a medium orange.<br><br>
                
3. Crush the handle. With a fork or large spoon, mash it until it acquires jam consistency.<br><br>
                
4. Dissolve the ascorbic acid in hot water, and add it to the mango and sugar mixture.<br><br>
                
5. Procuse it and put it in canned food according to the US Department of Agriculture's conservation guidelines. (USDA).<br><br>
                
6. For every 230 to 290 g or 1 small jar of mango jam, you will have to add about 4 to 6 times more than 500 mg of ascorbic acid, since you will not be using any artificial preservative. If the average sugar is 1: 1 (1 cup of mango for 1 cup of sugar), then you can keep it for 5 to 6 months without refrigeration. Those who are more careful with health may prefer to use a smaller proportion, but their life will be shorter too.<br><br>
                
7. If you keep it in a freezer, it will stay in good condition for 2 years (unopened); if you open it, 1 year.
