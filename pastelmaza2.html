            <p> 
                To prepare the marzipan cake recipe:<br><br>

1. This cake is somewhat laborious, but it's worth it, it comes out very tasty and original.<br><br>

 For the sponge cake:<br><br>
                   
2. Beat the eggs with the sugar very well and when the mixture takes body they are incorporated, stirring gently, the flour and the levadurita. This dough is taken to a circular mold of 24-26 centimeters in diameter, previously greased with butter and sprinkled with flour and baked in an oven at 190ºC for half an hour.<br><br>

3. It is removed and left to cool on an oven rack, when it is foolishly cold two horizontal cuts are made, in order to obtain three templates. We reserve.<br><br>

 For the yolk:<br><br>
                   
4. Put water and sugar in a bowl, place it on the fire and, when the boil is broken, remove it a little and add the eggs and cornstarch, already mixed beforehand. It is stirred well and closer to the fire, it is still stirring until the boil is broken again. It is transferred to another container and allowed to cool for use.<br><br>

 For the pastry cream<br><br>

6. From ½ liter of milk separate a cup in which we will dilute the cornstarch and egg yolk. We remove until everything is well mixed. We reserve. <br><br>

7. In a separate saucepan put the remaining milk, sugar and lemon peel. We approach the fire, stirring from time to time. When it breaks the boil, we separate it from the fire, we throw the mixture that we had reserved and put back to the fire. We stir until it boils and a thick cream results. Let cool before use.<br><br>

 For the marzipan:<br><br>
                
8. Carefully mix the almonds, sugar and egg whites slightly beaten. We work until we get the marzipan. We reserve in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap. This process is best done the day before.<br><br>

For the syrup:<br><br>
                   
9. In a saucepan, put the sugar, water and lemon peel, and let it cook until you get a syrup about a loose thread.<br><br>

For assembly:<br><br>
                
    10. Place one of the bases in a tray and get drunk with the syrup, then spread a layer of pastry cream, then another layer of sponge cake, we drunk it and spread the yolk over it, closing it with the last sponge cake and we spread the rest of the yolk over and over. Finally we cover the cake with a thin sheet of marzipan. The decoration is to everyone's taste, I in this case I made a flower and some lines made with a blowtorch.
